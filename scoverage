Scala 2.12 → Use Scoverage 7.0.1
Scala 2.13 → Use Scoverage 7.0.1 or 8.1
Scala 3.x → Use Scoverage 8.1

1. Understanding the Two Parts of Scoverage
(a) Compiler Plugin (scalac-scoverage-plugin.jar)
This is the actual plugin that instruments the Scala code for coverage.
It needs to match your Scala version.
The Scoverage Gradle Plugin automatically downloads the correct version.
(b) Runtime Library (scoverage-runtime.jar)
This library is needed at runtime to collect coverage data.
It must match the version of scalac-scoverage-plugin.

gradle dependencies --configuration scoverage

tasks.register('scoverageDependencies', DependencyReportTask) {
    configuration = 'scoverage'
}



tasks.register('printScoverageDependencies') {
    doLast {
        configurations.scoverage.resolvedConfiguration.resolvedArtifacts.each {
            println "Scoverage Dependency: ${it.moduleVersion.id}"
        }
    }
}
