### **Verbal Reasoning (22 Questions)**

#### **Passage 1:**  
The human brain is a complex organ that controls thought, memory, emotion, and every process that regulates our body. Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This ability is crucial for learning, memory, and recovery from brain injuries.

5. What is the main concern discussed in the passage?  
6. What has contributed to antibiotic resistance?  
7. True or False: The World Health Organization has not addressed antibiotic resistance.

#### **Passage 3:**  
Climate change is a significant threat to global health. Rising temperatures can lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves, which can cause heatstroke and dehydration. Additionally, climate change can affect the spread of infectious diseases by altering the habitats of disease-carrying organisms.

9. What is the main topic of the passage?  
10. How can climate change affect infectious diseases?  
11. True or False: Heatwaves are not a health risk associated with climate change.

#### **Passage 4:**  
The placebo effect occurs when a patient experiences a real improvement in their condition after receiving a treatment that has no therapeutic effect. This phenomenon highlights the power of the mind in influencing physical health.

13. What is the placebo effect?
